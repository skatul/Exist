# Exist
Creating a GitHub project for your new language **Exist** is a great way to get started. It will give you a clear structure for the project, allow you to document the process, and help you track progress while building a community around your language. I can help you structure the project, suggest a project description, and include important sections like objectives, setup instructions, and planned features.

Here’s a **draft for your GitHub repository**:

## **Repository Name**: `Exist-Language`

### **Description**:

Exist is a new programming language designed to natively handle time-dependent variables, where every variable is unique in its **time-space continuum**. It integrates concepts from quantum computing and dynamic systems modeling, enabling a deeper interaction with time-bound data in applications like financial modeling, quantum simulations, and real-time event systems.

### **About**:

**Exist** introduces a fundamentally new approach to programming by treating variables as **time-dependent**, where the value of each variable is not only influenced by its current state but also by its **position in the time-space continuum**. This allows for operations on variables that dynamically change depending on time, making it ideal for **financial modeling**, **quantum simulations**, and **event-driven applications**.

The language will allow developers to perform operations with the awareness of **temporal evolution**, allowing for more accurate predictions, simulations, and dynamic computations. This concept draws inspiration from **quantum computing**, where states can be in multiple timeframes simultaneously, and extends it to real-world applications.

---

### **Features**:

* **Time-aware Variables**: Each variable has an inherent time component that evolves over the course of its use.
* **Temporal Operations**: Supports mathematical and logical operations that reflect the **evolution of time**.
* **Quantum-inspired**: Leverages concepts from quantum computing, such as the idea of states existing in multiple timelines.
* **Financial Modeling Focus**: Built with financial applications in mind, making it ideal for dynamic asset allocation, prediction models, and more.
* **Event-driven Systems**: Perfect for real-time simulations and IoT systems that need to track data and actions over time.
* **Differentiation & Integration**: Native support for **time-based calculus**, allowing users to differentiate and integrate variables based on their time evolution.

---

### **Project Goals**:

* **Compiler**: Build a compiler that can translate **Exist code** into executable machine code or another intermediate format (e.g., C code or bytecode).
* **Interpreter**: Initially, provide an **interpreter** to run small-scale programs directly.
* **Core Language Features**: Implement basic language features, such as time-dependent variable declarations, temporal operations (e.g., addition of time-bound variables), and native time-based mathematical functions.
* **Documentation & Tutorials**: Provide extensive documentation and tutorials to help new users understand the **time-aware paradigm**.
* **Integration with Existing Tools**: Ensure the language can easily integrate with other languages or systems commonly used in real-world applications (e.g., Python, C++).
* **Community Growth**: Build a community around the language, gather feedback, and iterate based on real-world use cases.

### **Installation**:

To get started with **Exist**, follow the installation instructions below:

#### Prerequisites:

* **C Compiler** (GCC, Clang, etc.)
* **Git** for cloning the repository

#### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Exist-Language.git
   cd Exist-Language
   ```

2. **Build the compiler**:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Run the compiler**:

   ```bash
   ./exist-compiler source_code.exist
   ```

---

### **Getting Started**:

Here’s a small example of **Exist** code that demonstrates how time-aware variables are used:

```exist
// Declare a time-bound variable with a value that evolves over time
let price = existential(100, "2025-08-20T14:30:00");

// Add two time-aware variables
let futurePrice = price + price;

// Output the future price (which will depend on time evolution)
print(futurePrice);
```

The above code snippet demonstrates the declaration of a time-aware variable `price` and performing an operation that evolves over time, producing a future value.

---

### **Usage**:

In **Exist**, time-bound variables are defined using the `existential` keyword. Here are some examples of **time-bound operations**:

* **Addition/Subtraction**: Adding two time-aware variables will return a result dependent on their time evolution.
* **Differentiation**: Differentiating a time-aware variable with respect to time will give the rate of change at that point in time.
* **Integration**: Integrating a time-aware variable will provide the accumulated value over a given time span.

Example of **differentiation** in Exist:

```exist
// Differentiate the variable price with respect to time
let dPrice = differentiate(price);
```

---

### **Planned Features**:

* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling for time-dependent operations, including bounds checking for time intervals.
* **Time-Based Debugging**: Implement a **debugger** that can show the state of variables at specific points in time.
* **IDE Integration**: Add support for editors (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) with syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Exist.
* **Support for Multi-Time Zones**: Extend the time component to handle variables from **different time zones** or **timelines**.
* **Performance Optimizations**: Focus on optimizing the compiler for speed and memory efficiency, especially for complex operations like integration and differentiation.
