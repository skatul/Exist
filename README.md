# Exist

## **Repository Name**: `Exist`

### **Description**:

Exist is a library designed to natively handle time-dependent variables, where every variable is unique in its **time-space continuum**. It integrates concepts from quantum computing and dynamic systems modeling, enabling a deeper interaction with time-bound data in applications like financial modeling, quantum simulations, and real-time event systems.

### **About**:

**Exist** introduces a fundamentally new approach by providing a library that treats variables as **time-dependent**, where the value of each variable is not only influenced by its current state but also by its **position in the time-space continuum**. This allows for operations on variables that dynamically change depending on time, making it ideal for **financial modeling**, **quantum simulations**, and **event-driven applications**.

The library allows developers to perform operations with the awareness of **temporal evolution**, enabling more accurate predictions, simulations, and dynamic computations. This concept draws inspiration from **quantum computing**, where states can be in multiple timeframes simultaneously, and extends it to real-world applications.

---

### **Features**:

- **Time-aware Variables**: Each variable has an inherent time component that evolves over the course of its use.
- **Temporal Operations**: Supports mathematical and logical operations that reflect the **evolution of time**.
- **Quantum-inspired**: Leverages concepts from quantum computing, such as the idea of states existing in multiple timelines.
- **Financial Modeling Focus**: Built with financial applications in mind, making it ideal for dynamic asset allocation, prediction models, and more.
- **Event-driven Systems**: Perfect for real-time simulations and IoT systems that need to track data and actions over time.
- **Differentiation & Integration**: Native support for **time-based calculus**, allowing users to differentiate and integrate variables based on their time evolution.

---

### **Project Goals**:

- **Core Library Features**: Implement basic features, such as time-dependent variable handling, temporal operations, and native time-based mathematical functions.
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Provide extensive documentation and tutorials to help new users understand the **time-aware paradigm**.
- **Integration with Existing Languages**: Ensure the library can easily integrate with commonly used programming languages (e.g., Python, C++).
- **Community Growth**: Build a community around the library, gather feedback, and iterate based on real-world use cases.

### **Getting Started**:

For a complete tutorial on using Exist, please see our [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md).

Here's a quick example of using the **Exist** library:

```cpp
#include <exist/Temporal.h>

int main() {
    exist::Temporal<double> price(100, "2025-08-20T14:30:00");
    std::cout << price.value() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

For more examples and detailed usage instructions, refer to the [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md).

### **Usage**:

In **Exist**, time-bound variables are created using the `Temporal` template class. Here are some examples of **time-bound operations**:

- **Addition/Subtraction**: Adding two time-aware variables will return a result dependent on their time evolution.
- **Differentiation**: Differentiating a time-aware variable with respect to time will give the rate of change at that point in time.
- **Integration**: Integrating a time-aware variable will provide the accumulated value over a given time span.

Example of **differentiation**:

```cpp
// Differentiate the variable price with respect to time
auto dPrice = exist::Math::differentiate(price);
```

---

### **Planned Features**:

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling for time-dependent operations, including bounds checking for time intervals.
- **Time-Based Debugging**: Implement a **debugger** that can show the state of variables at specific points in time.
- **IDE Integration**: Add support for editors (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) with syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Exist.
- **Support for Multi-Time Zones**: Extend the time component to handle variables from **different time zones** or **timelines**.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Focus on optimizing the compiler for speed and memory efficiency, especially for complex operations like integration and differentiation.
